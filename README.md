# Disc-TalkBot
MY FIRST PROJECT
In a nutshell, this bot will talk OVER 'marked' people in discord. Inspired by Andi.

## READ FOR SETUP
If you're completely new to this you will need Nodejs and VSCode installed.

Once the repo is cloned, in the same directory as packages.json run **npm install**.
After this step running the main.js will start up the bot!!

### Note:
-You will need to change config.json to suit 
-May need to manually create the input role for the target discord

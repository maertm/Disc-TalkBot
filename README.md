# Disc-TalkBot
MY FIRST PROJECT.
In a nutshell, this bot will talk OVER 'marked' people in discord. Inspired by Andi.

## READ FOR SETUP
If you're completely new to this you will need Nodejs and VSCode installed;
https://nodejs.org/en/,
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Once the repo is cloned, in the same directory as packages.json run **npm install**.
After this step running the main.js will start up the bot!! 

## Note:
You will need to change config.json to suit AND may need to manually create the input role for the target discord.
Lastly, by default, **"!g help"** will show all the bot commands needed to mark/unmark target and join/leave channels.
